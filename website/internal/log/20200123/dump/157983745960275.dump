Students in these courses will learn how a computer works and how to write programs in order to use the computer as a problem solving tool. A major focus of the class will be on developing problem-solving skills (e.g., how to decompose a problem into more manageable parts and how to combine those parts into an overall solution). CS 0012 in particular will focus on problems related to the humanities and allied social sciences. Domain-specific projects and labs will be assigned throughout the course to encourage students in these fields to apply computing to their studies.

Thus, the emphasis is on how to model ones own data and how to use available database management systems effectively. Towards this end, the relational and the object-relational models are discussed in great detail and object-oriented and other data models are also presented. Commercial database management systems are examined and students get practical experience through the use of such systems.

The course will explore the concept of Cloud Computing, considering both its benefits and challenges. The course will also cover the basic design principles and architectures of Cloud Computing, including its usability and utility to deliver efficiently and flexibly infrastructure, platform and software as a service. Topics include types of public, private and hybrid cloud computing services, data centers architecture and deployment, cloud computing programming models, virtualization and virtual networking and storage, and large-scale distributed processing framework to manage, process and store big data applications running in clustered systems.  The course will also include hands-on projects focused on developing applications on a MapReduce and Hadoop cluster. Upon successfully completing the course of the course, students will gain understating of the goals, benefits and models of cloud computing, and how storage, processing and services are designed and managed in a virtualized environment. Through hands-on projects, students will demonstrate proficiency in deploying and evaluating cloud computing applications and services. They will be able to design and deploy data-centered applications and services, and efficiently use frameworks and tools for data analytics.

                                    [description] => The 2010 National Educational Technology Plan outlined how "The challenge for our education system is to leverage the learning sciences and modern technology to create engaging, relevant, and personalized learning experiences for all learners." While instruction has traditionally been one-size-fits-all, the rise of web-based and mobile technologies provide an opportunity to automatically detect what learners need and adapt instruction to their unique prior knowledge, motivation, and preferences. In this seminar course, we survey different types of personalization in educational technologies (e.g., cognitive, metacognitive, social, motivational), computational modeling techniques for representing learners and their needs, and best practices in designing personalized supports for learners. Students will lead one or more class discussions, participate in the other discussions, and complete a group course project.   Students must have a foundational knowledge of algorithms and data structures before enrolling in this course.
